# AirBnB_clone
# THE CONSOLE
The AirBnB Clone Console is the first part of the AirBnB project. The final product of the AirBnB project will be look-alike of the AirBnB website with some similar functionality.
In this segment, a command line interprater is created to manage objects for the AirBnB-Clone project.

<h3>The console is supposed to perform the following:</h3>

* Create a new Object(...user, place, etc.)
* Retrieve an object from a file eg. a database
* Update an object and it's attributes
* Perform operations on objects(...count objects, etc)
* Destroy an object
